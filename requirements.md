# Airbnb Clone â€” Backend Requirement Specifications

## Overview
This document outlines the technical and functional requirements for key backend features of the **Airbnb Clone** project.  
The backend will provide secure APIs for managing users, properties, and bookings, ensuring efficient data validation, performance, and scalability.

## 1. User Authentication System

### Description
The authentication system manages user registration, login, and session handling. It ensures that only authorized users can access restricted endpoints.

### Functional Requirements
- Allow users to register with valid credentials (email, password, full name).
- Validate email format and ensure password strength.
- Authenticate users and issue JSON Web Tokens (JWT) upon login.
- Enable secure logout by invalidating tokens.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/register` | Register a new user |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/login` | Authenticate user and return JWT |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/logout` | Invalidate the user session |

### Input / Output Specifications

**Register Request**

```json
{
  "full_name": "Soala George",
  "email": "soala@example.com",
  "password": "StrongPassword123!"
}
```

**Register Response**

```json
{
  "message": "User registered successfully.",
  "user_id": "u12345",
  "status": "success"
}
```

**Login Request**

```json
{
  "email": "soala@example.com",
  "password": "StrongPassword123!"
}
```

**Login Response**

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

### Validation Rules
- Email must be unique and valid.

- Password must contain at least 8 characters, including one uppercase, one number, and one special character.

- Full Name cannot be empty.

### Performance Criteria
- Authentication requests should complete within 300ms under normal load.

- Tokens must expire after 60 minutes of inactivity.

## 2. Property Management System

### Description
This module allows hosts to create, update, delete, and view property listings.

### Functional Requirements
- Hosts can list new properties with details like title, location, price, and description.

- Only authenticated users can manage their own properties.

- Guests can view all available properties without authentication.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/properties` | Create a new property listing |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/properties` | Retrieve all available properties |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/properties/:id` | Retrieve a single property by ID |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/properties/:id` | Update a property listing |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/properties/:id` | Delete a property listing |

### Input / Output Specifications

**Create Property Request**

```json
{
  "title": "Cozy Apartment in Lagos",
  "location": "Lagos, Nigeria",
  "price_per_night": 120,
  "description": "A modern 2-bedroom apartment near the beach.",
  "host_id": "u12345"
}
```

**Create Property Response**

```json
{
  "message": "Property listed successfully.",
  "property_id": "p7890",
  "status": "success"
}
```

### Validation Rules

- **Title:** Required, minimum 3 characters.

- **Location:** Required.

- **Price:** Must be a positive number.

- **Description:** Optional but recommended.

### Performance Criteria
- Must handle up to 500 concurrent property queries efficiently.

- Caching should be used for frequent property searches to reduce latency.

---

## 3. Booking System

### Description
The booking system manages the process of reserving properties, checking availability, and confirming payments.

### Functional Requirements
- Guests can book available properties by specifying dates.

- Prevent double booking of the same property within the same date range.

- Support booking cancellation within a configurable period.

- Generate booking confirmations and receipts.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/bookings` | Create a new booking |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/bookings/:id` | Retrieve booking details |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/bookings/:id` | Cancel a booking |

### Input / Output Specifications

**Booking Request**

```json
{
  "property_id": "p7890",
  "guest_id": "u54321",
  "check_in": "2025-11-01",
  "check_out": "2025-11-05"
}
```

**Booking Response**

```json
{
  "booking_id": "b001",
  "status": "confirmed",
  "message": "Booking successful."
}
```

### Validation Rules

- Check-in must be before Check-out.

- Property must exist and be available.

- User must be authenticated.

### Performance Criteria

- Booking transactions must complete within 500ms.

- Database queries should be optimized using indexes on property_id and booking_dates.

### API Endpoints Overview

| Feature     | Endpoint                  | Method | Description           |
|------------|---------------------------|--------|----------------------|
| User Auth  | /api/v1/auth/register     | POST   | Register new users    |
| User Auth  | /api/v1/auth/login        | POST   | User login            |
| Property   | /api/v1/properties        | POST   | Create property listing |

### Appendix

**Technologies**

- **Backend Framework:** Node.js (Express)

- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL

- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token)

- **Hosting:** AWS EC2 / Render / Railway

**Security Considerations**

- All sensitive data (passwords, tokens) should be encrypted.

- Input validation and sanitization must prevent SQL injection or XSS.

- Rate limiting should be implemented on authentication endpoints.
